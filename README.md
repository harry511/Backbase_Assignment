##  Description

This assessmentâ€™s goal is to measure the candidate's knowledge of Git, test case creation, test reporting, and the ability to adapt to automation tools.

The purpose of this assessment is to show your API and Web testing skills, knowledge in Git, test case creation, testing approach, and reporting, and the ability to adapt with automation tools.

We will evaluate the technical test depending on your seniority level by evaluating:

* the test strategy
* test coverage
* test cases
* practices adopted

## Prerequisites to develop the tests
- GitHub account

## Application Under Test

**BBlog** is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone).
It has an API that uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication and a Web interface that implements the API and enables the final users to use it through a web browser.

### General functionality

All the functionalities bellow are implemented in the API and Web layers:

- CRUD Articles
- CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)
- GET and display paginated lists of articles
- Favorite articles
- Follow other users

### API layer

The API endpoints and JSON return Objects are described in the [Api Specs](api-specs.md) document.

### Web Layer

The URLs, user to autenticate and basic functionalities descriptions are placed in the [Web Specs](web-specs.md) document.

## Deliverables

### Must-haves

These are the items you must deliver in your assignment

* Create a **document containing a series of manual test cases** that cover **two functionality** that you choose
* Create, at least, 2 (two) **automated scripts for API tests** for different functionalities that can be run successfully
* Create, at least, 2 (two) **automated scripts for Web tests** for different functionalities that can be run successfully
* Create an **Overall Evaluation Report** for the application containing:
   * the issues found
   * why you chose the test cases to automate
   * any other additional information you would like to add, e.g. risks, recommendations, approach, etc.
* An **automatic test report** that must be generated after the tests run 
* Clear **README** file containing:
   * how to run the test cases/suite (assume the reader does not know your coding language)
   * how to access the generated report

### Nice to have
* Suggestions for improvements
* Toggle for on/off headless execution for the front-end tests
* CI/CD scripts in any tool (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Travis CI, etc..)
* Add more tests in addition to mandatory ones that will show us how do you approach test automation, which cases prefer to automate, why.
If any of additional tests should be failing because of existing bugs, please mention them explicitly in evaluation report. 
* Framework modules that can demonstrate your skills in the design and implementation of testing frameworks, e.g. layers, design patterns, or other architectural decisions. Please hold the balance of solution complexity vs tasks being solved, do not overengineer

### We will not accept
* Use of record & play tools to generate both API and Web automated tests
* Deliver the API part with no code. Ex: Postman collections, Karate specifications, etc...

### Additional information
* Candidates that do not deliver all the **Must haves** will be automatically rejected
* You can either create only one project for the API and Web part. If you decide to create separate projects you must send both links
* You can use any programming language you like but as we work with Java and Javascript we would appreciate the tech assignment in one of these

## How to deliver the assignment

### What do you need to deliver to us
As soon as you finish you must:

* Deliver the assignment in a private GitHub repository
  * please, add the following users to your repositories: 
     * General reviewers: `eliasnogueira` and `asterium`
     * Your tech recruiter (only one):
       * Denise: `BackbaseTests`
       * Adrian: `adriansurapati`
       * Jakub: `JakJania`
       * Mandy: `MandyatBackbase`
* Don't forget to tell us where are the documents you created

### How long do I have to deliver the assignment?

* You can allocate as much time as needed, however focus on delivering your solution within 7 days from the moment of receiving the assignment. If more time is needed, please reach out to discuss the deadline
